Students explore what RPA is and where it is useful, how RPA fits into current information technology setups, extracting and manipulating data from both external and internal sources, generating reports and statistics, and orchestrating multi-robot installations. Core concepts are extended by a research project where a complex automation problem is analysed and a solution implemented and tested."
